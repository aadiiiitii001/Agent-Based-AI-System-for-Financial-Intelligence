# 🧠 Enterprise Agent-Based Financial Intelligence System

An **agent-based AI system** designed for **financial risk analysis, compliance monitoring, and decision support**, built using modern backend engineering practices and secure AI orchestration.

This project demonstrates how **multi-agent AI systems** can be safely deployed in **finance-grade environments** using **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**, audit logging, and containerized infrastructure.

---

## 🚀 Why This Project Matters (Market Relevance)

This system aligns directly with **current IT & finance trends**:

- Agent-based AI systems (used in trading, risk, compliance)
- Secure AI tool orchestration (MCP-style governance)
- Explainable AI (XAI) for financial decisions
- Cloud-ready microservice architecture
- Auditability & compliance-first design

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### 🔹 Core Agents
- **Orchestrator Agent**
  - Routes queries to specialized agents
  - Aggregates structured responses

- **Risk Agent**
  - Evaluates market risk & volatility
  - Produces explainable risk scores

- **Compliance Agent**
  - Detects regulatory & compliance concerns
  - Designed for RAG / PDF analysis extension

### 🔹 MCP Server
- Centralized tool execution layer
- Enforces security, access control & auditability
- Prevents direct agent-tool interaction
